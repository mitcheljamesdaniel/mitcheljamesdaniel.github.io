### Mitch Daniel

I am an evolutionary biologist interestd in the causes and consequences of social behavior. 

I am currently a Dean's Postdoctoral Fellow at Florida State University, hosted by Kim Hughes. As a postdoc, my work focuses on the causes of frequency-dependent female mating preferences for male color patterns, and the consequences of negative frequency-dependent selection on those color patterns.

Prior to coming to Florida State, I did my PhD on kin recognition, inbreeding avoidance, and male-male competition with Helen Rodd at the University of Toronto. Before that, I studied biology at Queen's Universiy.
