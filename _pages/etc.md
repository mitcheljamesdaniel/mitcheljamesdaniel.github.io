## Diversity in Science

The lack of diversity in science is an important issue and it is our responsibility to educate ourselves about diversity issues in science, learn how to best combate discrimination, and work to promote equity and build an inclusive scientific community. I am always happy to talk about these and related issues and will actively work to keep the Josephs lab an inclusive and welcoming space.

## Mental Health Resources
Graduate school and academic jobs can be difficult and, while we wish it were not the case, mental health issues are unfortunately common. It's important for members of the academic community who are struggling to know that they are not alone. As an advisor, I strive to take the mental health of lab members seriously. Below are some further readings and resources.
