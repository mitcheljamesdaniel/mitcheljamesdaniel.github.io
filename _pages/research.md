# Research

I am broadly interested in understanding how selection, evolutionary constraints, and plasticity shape social behavior, as well as the consequences of social behavior for genetic and trait variation. I tackle these questions by developing new theory, and conducting field and laboratory experiments, with an emphasis on testing widely held assumptions. My empirical work leverages the Trinidadian guppy (<i>Poecilia reticulata</i>), an excellent model system for behavioral and morphological evolutionary ecology.

## How do organisms recognize their kin?

Kin recognition systems allow organisms to adjust their behavior depending on relatedness to their social partners, enabling or enhancing a wide range of behavioral strategies including inbreeding and outbreeding avoidance, nepotism, and the formation of cooperative kin groups. Though kin recognition has been documented in a wide range of animal, plant, and microbial taxa, the underlying proximate mechanisms are poorly understood. Resolving these mechanisms is crucial for determining the kinds of ecological pressures that gave rise to kin recognition, the patterns of kin discrimination that play out in populations, and, therefore, the consequences of kin recognition for ecological and evolutionary dynamics.

Specific questions addressed by my research include (1) whether developmental exposure to the phenotypes of kin facilitates kin recognition, (2) whether individuals use population estimates - information about the "phenotypic space" of the local population - to calibrate their kin recognition systems, and (3) how population genetic factors affect the reliability of kin recognition across different ecological contexts.

## How does kin recognition shape sexual interactions?

Genetic relatedness is expected to alter the fitness consequences of sexual interactions.

Inbreeding depression has been widely (though not ubiquitously) observed, yet evidence of inbreeding avoidance is much less common. I study how, and under what circumstances, guppies use kin recognition to avoid inbreeding, helping to resolve how selection and plasticity shape inbreeding strategies.

Relatedness has been proposed to relax intrasexual competition, because competition with kin entails added, indirect fitness costs. I have tested this hypothesis using a combination of mathematical modelling, behavioral experiments, and genetic measures of multiple paternity in natural populations. This work showed that male guppies use kin recognition to optimally balance selfish and nepotistic strategies of sexual competition, maximizing the total fitness payoffs from their mating effort. I am interested in studying how males are able, as we found, to integrate information about female quality and the competitive landscape - including competitor relatedness - to make finely-tuned competitive decisions.

### Frequency-dependent sexual selection and the maintenance of ecologically-relevant variation?

Populations harbor enormous genetic variation even for traits under strong natural selection. Resolving the processes that maintain this variation is a fundamentally important question in evolutionary biology. I am studying whether variation in male guppy color patterns - one of the most extreme examples of morphological polymorphism - is maintained by sexual selection.

Female guppies have robust mating preferences for rare or novel color patterns, which has been proposed to generate negative frequency-dependent selection on male color patterns. I am combining experimental evolution and behavioral experiments to ask whether female mate choice can maintain color pattern polymorphism over evolutionary timescales. I am also using geometric morphometrics, population genomics, and quantitative genetics to characterize the consequences of female mate choice for within and among population variation at the phenotypic and genetic levels.

I am also studying the evolutionary origins of female mating preference for novel phenotypes. My recent work suggests that habituation can account for mating preference for novel phenotypes, and that this preference may be a by-product of selection favoring neophilia in non-sexual contexts. I am interested in investigating the neurological mechanisms underpinning this mating preference, and testing whether they constitute a sensory bias for novelty.


## Study systems

We are open to working in a number of crop or wild plant species. Some lab favorites are described below.

**Corn ('Maize', *Zea mays subsp. mays*)** is not only delicious but a great genetic model for thinking about adaptation during domestication and breeding. Maize is currently grown at a staggering scale (over 96 million acres in the US alone!!) but is also grown world-wide in a range of habitats.

***Capsella grandiflora*** is a small weedy annual native to northern Greece and Albania. It often gets mistaken for its Brassicaceous relative Arabidopsis, but it is much cooler than Arabidopsis: heart-shaped fruit, obligate outcrossing, and close relatives *Capsella rubella*, *Capsella orientalis*, and *Capsella bursa-pastoris* that can be found across the globe.
