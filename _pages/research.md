# Research

I am broadly interested in understanding how selection, evolutionary constraints, and plasticity shape social behavior, as well as the consequences of social interactions for genetic and trait variation. I tackle these questions by developing new theory, field studies, and laboratory experiments, with an emphasis on testing widely held assumptions. My empirical work has leveraged the Trinidadian guppy (<i>Poecilia reticulata</i>), an excellent model system for behavioral and morphological evolutionary ecology.

## How do organisms recognize their kin?

Social interactions are nearly ubiquitous, and have important fitness consequences. Kin recognition systems allow organisms to adjust their behavior depending on relatedness to their social partners, enabling or enhancing a wide range of behavioral strategies including inbreeding and outbreeding avoidance, nepotism, and the formation of cooperative kin groups. Though kin recognition has been documented in a wide range of animal, plant, and microbial taxa, the proximate mechanisms underpinning kin recognition remain poorly understood. This gap presents an obstacle to addressing fundamental questions about the kinds of ecological pressures have given rise to kin recognition, the patterns of kin discrimination that play out in populations, and, therefore, the consequences of kin recognition for ecological and evolutionary dynamics.

Specific questions addressed by my research include (1) how exposure to the phenotypes of kin facilitates kin recognition, (2) whether individuals use population estimates - information about the "phenotypic space" of the local population - to calibrate their kin recognition systems, and (3) how population genetic factors affect the reliability of kin recognition across different ecological contexts.

## How does kin recognition shape sexual interactions?

Genetic relatedness is expected to alter the fitness consequences of sexual interactions. I am studying the behavioral strategies that organisms use to enhance the fitness outcomes of mate choice and intrasexual competition.

Inbreeding depression has been widely (though not ubiquitously) observed, leading many behavioral ecologists to predict that inbreeding avoidance should be similarly common. Yet, many taxa exhibiting inbreeding depression do not avoid inbreeding. As part of my PhD work with Helen Rodd (University of Toronto), I examined how, and when, female guppies use different kin recognition systems to avoid mating with closely related suitors.

Relatedness among males has been proposed to relax intrasexual competition, because competition with kin entails added, indirect fitness costs. In collaboration with Robert Williamson (Rose-Hulman Technical Institute), I used a combination of mathematical modelling and large-scale behavioral experiments to ask whether males integrate information about female quality, competitor presence, and competitor relatedness when allocating their mating effort, and whether male competitive strategies have been fine-tuned by kin selection.

### Frequency-dependent sexual selection and the maintenance of ecologically-relevant variation?





## Study systems

We are open to working in a number of crop or wild plant species. Some lab favorites are described below.

**Corn ('Maize', *Zea mays subsp. mays*)** is not only delicious but a great genetic model for thinking about adaptation during domestication and breeding. Maize is currently grown at a staggering scale (over 96 million acres in the US alone!!) but is also grown world-wide in a range of habitats.

***Capsella grandiflora*** is a small weedy annual native to northern Greece and Albania. It often gets mistaken for its Brassicaceous relative Arabidopsis, but it is much cooler than Arabidopsis: heart-shaped fruit, obligate outcrossing, and close relatives *Capsella rubella*, *Capsella orientalis*, and *Capsella bursa-pastoris* that can be found across the globe.
