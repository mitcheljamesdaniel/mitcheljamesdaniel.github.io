- title: "Female guppies can recognize kin but only avoid incest when previously mated"

  description: "We showed that female guppies that have previously mated can avoid inbreeding by discriminating against potential suitors with whom they are closely related and/or familiar. However, virgin females do not exhibit this preference. These results may help to explain why many mate choice studies, which typically test only the preferences of virgin females, have failed to find evidence of inbreeding avoidance despite widespread evidence of inbreeding depression"
